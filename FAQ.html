The list of identified trainers must be provided to the Program Coordinator/DULT. <br>The trainer must undergo a minimum of six (6) hours of training (theoretical and practical) and qualify in the test conducted by the instructors as per the prescribed format. Upon completion of the training, the instructor will evaluate the skill sets acquired by the trainer and fill a trainer’s graduation form.

        <ul>
          <li>Low or no traffic area/low traffic road. Example: playground, parking lot, driveway of an institution etc. However, it should not be an isolated location which participants may find unsafe to come and get trained. </li>
          <li>Even surface such as paved, tarred, stoneless ground etc. The slope should be gentle (1-3 degrees). </li>
          <li>Road width - Enough space should be available for the cycle learner to drift sideways without hitting any obstacle.</li>
          <li>Adequate lighting has to be ensured if the trainings are planned early morning or evenings.</li>
        </ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: kannada">Once all approvals are in place, the organization can publicise about the training programs through different platforms to ensure that potential candidates are well informed about the program. During the outreach programs, the organizations are expected to follow the prescribed terms and conditions relating to branding etc.</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: kannada">Interested individuals who wish to learn cycling can enrol into the Pedal Shaale Program by filling out the participant’s signup form, or the trainers/organization will help the participants to fill the form.
